# ATMExercise

**Simple React ATM:**

**Description:** This is one of my first applications in React. It focuses on managing state across components and rendering data using React. It is a simple ATM machine accepting deposits and withdrawals. Users can use the same submit form, but they must indicate whether they are depositing or withdrawing money based on the button they select. The ATM accepts any deposit any amount (numbers must be greater than zero). Withdrawals are limited to multiples of $20 bills. Another functionality is that users cannot withdraw cash if the amount exceeds the current account balance.

**How to run:** You will need to initiate a local server to launch the application. Once in the application, you can select the transaction and input amounts in the form and submit to see the balance update.

**Roadmap:** Future interesting improvements for users would be to have the form reset to zero once they submit. Add a button to confirm the transaction before submitting. Option to select the bill size ($20, $100). These implementations are TBD.
